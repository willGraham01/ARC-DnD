# [ARC DnD][deployment-site]

This repository holds a collection of the resources that ARC uses to play Dungeons and Dragons (5e).
It is deployed as a website which you can head to by [following this link][deployment-site].

## What is here?

Lots of things are here.
Or at least that's the intention!
We have (or are planning to have):

- [A character creation and levelling up guide.][character-creation]
- A log of character sheets for easy access.
- A small introduction to the ARC DnD setting.
- An adventure log for what's happened so far.

## Contributing

You can open a pull request against this repository to add things to the website.
Pull requests must pass our build checks before being merged.

title: Levelling Up
description: An overview of the things to do when your character gains a level.
---

After going on a few adventures, your character might have accumulated enough experience that is reflected in a level up.
Some adventures might ask you to create a character who starts at a particular level so that the challenge of the adventure is balanced against the abilities that the players have available.

The process for levelling up during a campaign or at character creation is the same.
If you need to level up more than once, simply keep applying level ups one after the other until you reach the desired level.
You can also bundle certain steps together in one go - EG roll for all your new hit points (HP) at once.
When creating a character starting at a particular level, first create a level 1 character and then apply the level ups.

As an example, we'll use Erik Wendell from the character creation guide.
Erik will be gaining two levels, going from level 1 to level 3.

## Overview

The process of levelling up is usually fairly quick at a high-level overview:

1. Increase your max HP
2. Increase your number of hit dice
3. Update the level on your character sheet
4. Apply any benefits that you get from your class that you took the level in

The final point is by far the most time consuming due to the variety of abilities that classes will offer and the different rates at which they come in.
But we can at least highlight what to look out for when you do it.

## Increase your max HP

When you level up, you increase your maximum HP by the amount dictated by your class (see the "hit points after 1st level" that your class offers).
For each class, this involves:

- Roll a dice that's the same as your class's hit dice.
- Add your CON modifier to the roll.
- Increase your max HP by the total.

Some DnD groups use the rule that instead of rolling a dice, you can take the average of your hit dice as the result of the dice roll instead.
Overall, it shouldn't matter too much as rolling will average out over the period of several level ups, unless you have Will's ability to roll 1s.

### Example: Erik's HP

Erik's HP currently sits at 13, the starting amount provided by his Ranger class plus is CON modifier.
The Ranger hit dice is a d10, and Erik is gaining two levels so he rolls twice:

- The first is 4 + CON mod = 7, slightly below average but that's what happens sometimes.
- The second is 9 + CON mod = 12, which helps to offset the balance there!

for a total of 19 extra hit points.
He adds that to his current maximum for a total of 32.

## Increase your Number of Hit Die

The number of hit dice you have available (to use to recover HP during rests) also increases when you level up.
You gain one hit dice per level up you're conducting.
The hit dice is the same as your class's hit die.

### Example: Erik's Hit Dice

Erik currently has 1d10 hit dice available to use for healing.
Since he levelled up twice, and the Ranger hit dice is a d10, he now has a total of 3d10 hit dice available for healing during rests.

## Update your Character Sheet Level

Don't forget to increase the number after your class on your character sheet as you level up!

If your class gets access to their _subclass_ during this process, you can write that next to your class too.
You might not know this happens until the next step, in which case don't forget to come back and do this when it happens!

### Getting your Subclass

If you're playing a story-driven campaign, usually you'll pick your subclass based on your character's backstory or the events of the story that have transpired so far.
There is no obligation to do this of course - but if you're not sure what to pick, this can be a helpful way to make the decision.

### Example: Erik's Levels

Erik has gone from Ranger 1 to Ranger 3 during his two level ups.
At level 3, Rangers get their subclass so the top of Erik's character sheet now reads "Ranger 3 (Fey Wanderer)".
Note that Erik will actually make his choice of subclass in the next step, and this is a retroactive addition once he realises he picks his subclass!

## Apply any Class Benefits

The final thing to do is to apply the benefits you get from your class; these can be any combination of

- Additional spells and slots
- Additional features or traits
- Additional attacks or changes to your attack modifier(s)
- Bumps to your armour class, initiative, or skill proficiencies
- An increase to your proficiency bonus

With the previous steps, it doesn't really matter if you do all the level ups at once or one after the other.
For this step though, you should go through the process one level at a time - this is particularly important for spellcasting characters, as you can only swap out a certain number of spells each time you level up, and the list you can swap to changes as you get stronger.

One thing to watch out for is an increase to your proficiency bonus.
When this happens, don't forget to increase the values (if you're using values over formulae) for your skill modifiers, spell attack and save DC, and saving throws - your proficiency bonus applies to all of them!

### Example: Erik's Levelling Up

At level 2, Rangers get to pick a Fighting Style feature.
Erik opts to go with Two-Weapon Fighting as his style, since this suits his current setup.
As a result, his "Shortsword (off hand)" attack receives an update: he now adds his ability modifier to the damage it does, so it goes from "1d6 piercing damage" to "1d6 + DEX piercing damage".
Since this is now the same as his main hand, he just removes one of the entries and makes a note that both hands are the same.
He also writes his chosen fighting style into his features and traits column, and copies it onto his spare sheet of paper.

In addition, at level 2 Rangers get access to spellcasting, so Erik heads over to that page of his character sheet.
Rangers are told that their spellcasting ability is Wisdom, which he records.
He then calculates his spell attack bonus and spell save DC using the formulae provided by the Ranger class:

- Spell attack modifier: proficiency bonus + WIS. In Erik's case, this comes to 4: proficiency bonus of +2, and a WIS modifier of +2. He writes "spell attack modifier" in his list of attacks for a quick reference should he need it.
- Spell save DC: 8 + proficiency bonus + WIS. In Erik's case, this comes to 12.

He then looks at the table for Rangers and spellcasting - at level 2, he knows two spells and has 2 first level spell slots.
He marks the spell slots down on his character sheet, and chooses the following spells to learn:

- Cure Wounds
- Hunter's Mark

He also notices the rules for Rangers when learning spells: every time he levels up _after_ level 2, he can swap one spell he already knows out for any other (Ranger) spell he doesn't yet know, so long as he has the ability to cast it - he can't pick a 3rd level spell if he has no level 3 spell slots, for example.

Erik's proficiency bonus does not improve at level 2 (or level 3), so this finishes Erik's first level up.
He records everything onto his character sheet.

Next, he levels up again to level 3!
At level 3, Rangers get the Primal Awareness feature - this lets Erik learn additional spells for free, and cast them once per day without needing to use up a spell slot.
He writes Primal Awareness into his features and traits box.
He then copies the spells he learns (at this level) from this feature into the spells section of his character sheet - in this case, he gets the Speak with Animals spell for free.
He writes this down on his list of spells known - he might also want to write next to it "one cast for free per day" to remind him of the Primal Awareness feature.

At level 3, Erik also gets his subclass - referred to as a Ranger Archetype or Conclave.
He picks the "Fey Wanderer" option (and records his choice of subclass next to his class at the top of his sheet).
He then copies the features that this subclass gives him into his features and traits box:

- At level 3, being a Fey Wanderer gives him the "Dreadful Strikes" ability.
- It also gives him the Fey Magic ability, which (like Primal Awareness) lets him learn additional spells at certain levels, for free. He copies the spells that he gets at this level into the spells section.
- "Otherworldly Glamour" is another ability that Erik gets at this level, which he records in his features and traits box. This ability first gives him proficiency in either Deception, Performance, or Persuasion (his choice). He already has proficiency in persuasion, so he picks Deception and checks the skill box for it on his character sheet. This ability also says that "whenever he makes a CHA check, he adds his WIS modifier to the dice roll". As such, he changes the formulae for his persuasion, deception, performance, and intimidation skills from "+ proficiency bonus (if proficient) + CHA" to "+ proficiency bonus (if proficient) + CHA + WIS".
- Lastly, Erik's subclass also gives him an appearance change, which is for storytelling flavour. Whilst technically a feature, Erik also writes this cosmetic change into his appearance and background section. He now has fresh flowers growing out of his hair every morning.

Note that Erik picked "Fey Wanderer" largely because of his backstory which involved Fey influence in his past.

Finally, at level 3 Erik also learns a new spell of his choice, goes from 2 first level spell slots to 3 (which he updates), and he can swap one of the spells he currently knows out for another one.
Erik decides to learn Detect Magic, adding it to his list of spells.
He also decides to trade out Hunter's Mark for Entangle, swapping the one out for each other.

That's everything new that Erik gets in his levelling up.
He also double checks whether his proficiency bonus has increased, or any of his older features have improved with these level ups, but neither has happened so that's everything to be done - Erik is now level 3 and ready to go!

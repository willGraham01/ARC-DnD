Everyone needs a character before they can start playing, and the process of creating one can certainly be daunting if you haven't done it before.
And even after then, it's still pretty scary.
We have this guide setup to help you through this process, and don't be afraid to ask one of our more experienced players or DMs for help if you get stuck or something is unclear - there's a lot to get through!
For those who have played before, feel free to use this guide as a reminder for what you should be considering or what you need to check off when you create your character.

Before you get started, you'll need a character sheet template to write to - you can find the [5e standard template](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dnd/downloads/DnD_5E_CharacterSheet_FormFillable.pdf) here, and it's even form-fillable!
We tend to write our characters onto paper, and either add these scans directly to the site or translate them into a markdown / json format so they can be imported elsewhere.
You'll also - ideally - want a copy of the player's handbook for a reference about the various class and race options.

Due to the wealth of class options available - even at level 1 - we can't go into details about applying your particular class traits or features to your character sheet.
But a good idea is to write all of your class and race features that don't fall under one of the nice categories on the character sheet on a separate sheet of paper, and bring that along with you when you play.
That way, you'll have everything you need in one place when you turn up to play!

## Customisation Options and Quickstart guide

If you're a character creation veteran, you can head straight to our [creation guidelines](./creation-guidelines.md) which lists the customisation options and sources that we use when creating our characters.
Although if you want to give the guide a quick read through and provide feedback, you are more than welcome to!

If you're new or inexperienced in character creation, we recommend you start here.
We also run the content of this guide as an intro session occasionally, so if you'd rather do this in person check if there's a session coming up in which this is planned!

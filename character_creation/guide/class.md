title: Character Creation - Choosing your class
description: Recording your starting class information on your character sheet.
---

Once you have your ability scores, it's time to pick a class and assign them.
If you haven't decided on a class yet, check [our short summary](../classes-and-races-summary.md#classes) of the various classes on offer.

## Character Considerations

We're presenting choosing your class as the first thing that you should do when building your character.
Mechanically, this is because it's the easiest thing to do - choose a class (arguably the most important gameplay mechanic), then your race (second most), and then everything else.
It also means that you can build your character's personality and backstory _around_ the race and class that you choose later on.
However, this is by no means the only way to build a character - you might have a cool idea for their backstory, in which case this might influence the class you pick for them.
There is no "right answer" when it comes to the order of tasks when creating your character, so long as you remember to do everything.

## Pick Your Class

Pick your class from the list of classes available, and write it down in the space provided on your character sheet.

### Subclasses

At level 1, some classes also get access to their _subclass_ - this is a further set of options presented to each class to increase gameplay variety.
Other classes get this later on in their careers.
Normally getting access to your subclass is indicated by the class description saying something like:

> "At this level, you can pick one of X options from the following list.
> Your choice will grant you additional bonuses at future levels".

If you're not sure if your class is being given it's subclass, ask us and we can help.
We mention this here because, once you get your subclass, you write it in brackets next to your class on your character sheet.
For example, at level 1 Warlocks get their subclass ("otherworldly patron") and choose from a list of options.

- If they choose the Fiend patron, then they write their class as "Warlock (Fiend)"
- If they choose the Archfey patron, then they write their class as "Warlock (Archfey)"

Fighters meanwhile, don't get their subclass ("martial archetype") until level 3.
So they just write their class as "Fighter".
When they later _get_ their subclass, they update this with the option that they chose.

## Assign Your Ability Scores

Now that you have a class, you can actually assign those ability scores from before!
Assign each number to one of your ability scores.

Whilst there's free choice in how you do this, you should prioritise making your classes' primary (and secondary) ability scores your highest.
This will make sure your character is good at the stuff you expect to be doing a lot - it's not a lot of fun to play a character that can't do what they're supposed to.

### Important Ability Scores for each Class

We've listed the important ability scores for each class below.
Once you've assigned your important ability scores, you can fill in the rest - if you had a particular background in mind you might put the remaining "good" ability scores into those that complement this background, for example.
If you're not sure what to prioritise after your classes' important stats, you can't go wrong with making your CON score as high as possible.

- Artificer: INT, then CON
- Barbarian: STR, then CON, then DEX
- Bard: CHA, then DEX and CON
- Cleric: WIS, then STR and CON
- Druid: WIS, then DEX and CON
- Fighter: Either DEX or STR, then CON. If you plan to later subclass for some magical features, you might also want to make your INT your next highest score.
- Monk: DEX, then WIS and CON.
- Paladin:
  - If you want to be more melee focused; STR, then CON, then CHA.
  - If you want to be more spell and support focused; CHA, then CON and STR.
- Ranger:
  - Bow / range focus: DEX, then WIS, then CON.
  - Melee focus: DEX (or even STR if you fancy), CON, then WIS.
  - Spell focused: WIS, then DEX and CON. Generally though, if you want to be a spell-focused ranger, a Druid is a better choice of class.
- Rogue: DEX. Depending on your subclass or background, you might want INT, WIS, CHA to be next.
- Sorcerer: CHA, then CON.
- Warlock: CHA, then CON. If you plan to get involved in melee, you might also want a decent DEX.
- Wizard: INT, then CON.

### Improving Ability Scores

As you level up in a particular class, you will be granted Ability Score Improvements (ASIs) when you reach certain levels.
These will let you further improve one or more of your ability scores, to a maximum of 20.
So don't worry if your ability scores don't give you the biggest bonuses right at the start - this is completely normal!

You don't have to improve the ability scores that are recommended for your class, but it's normally best to.
If they're already at the maximum though, or an important ability score is at an odd number, you can also use this chance to take a "feat" - these are a selection of abilities that you can choose from.
If you want to take a feat, look through the list in the Player's Handbook and ask the DM if it's OK (it probably is, but just make sure).

## Record your Class Skills and Abilities

The first level in a class also provides you with a number of initial proficiencies; in some combination of skills, weapons, and armour.
Some classes might even offer tools as a proficiency.

Pick from the list of skills offered to your class (usually you have to choose from a selection) and mark them down on your character sheet.

- Skills should be ticked in the appropriate box to indicate proficiency.
- Weapons, armour, and tools go in the smaller box - you'll have to write them down manually.

Your class also tells you how to calculate your hit point maximum at level 1, and what your hit dice is.

- Write your hit point maximum in the box provided.
- Write down your hit dice in the hit dice box. You'll only have 2, but the _type_ of dice (d6, d8, d10, d12) is what's important.

## Record your Class Features

Finally, write down any class features that you get given at level 1.
Some of these will give you a choice (like "fighting style"), others will just give you a small boost.
If an ability has a limited number of uses, make sure to write that down too.

If one of your class features lets you learn a language, write that in the languages box on your character sheet.

## Pick Spells

If your class gets access to spells and spell slots at level 1, pick from the selection that it offers.
Write down how many spell slots you have, and the spells you know, on your character sheet.

With spells, there's normally a whole wealth to choose from and it can be overwhelming.
In general;

- If you have access to cantrips, you want at least one cantrip that does damage.
- If you have access to level 1 or higher spells, you'll need to pick those as well.
  - There's no catch-all way to decide this, but generally you want to make sure you have one damaging spell for every spell slot level.
  - Otherwise, pick the spells that sound cool, both in or out of combat. Damage isn't the only way magic can help in your adventures.

## Take Note of the Starting Equipment

Your class also provides you with some starting equipment, but we'll do this all at once at the end of character creation.

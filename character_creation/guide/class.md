title: Character Creation - Choosing your class
description: Recording your starting class information on your character sheet.
---

Once you have your ability scores, it's time to pick a class and assign them.
If you haven't decided on a class yet, check [our short summary](../classes-and-races-summary.md#classes) of the various classes on offer.

## Character Considerations

We're presenting choosing your class as the first thing that you should do when building your character.
Mechanically, this is because it's the easiest thing to do - choose a class (arguably the most important gameplay mechanic), then your race (second most), and then everything else.
It also means that you can build your character's personality and backstory _around_ the race and class that you choose later on.

However, this is by no means the only way to build a character - you might have an idea for their backstory, in which case this might influence the class you pick for them.
There is no "right answer" when it comes to the order of tasks when creating your character, so long as you remember to do everything.

### Example: Erik Wendell

As we go through this guide we will be building the character of Erik Wendell.
Erik was the first character concept that one of our DMs had when they starting playing, inspired by their most recent run through playing Skyrim.
Erik's fighting style was chosen to emulate the style that they had been using in that game, and from there a class and backstory was formed around the core concept.

Each section will have an example illustrated by filling in the details on Erik's character sheet.

## Pick Your Class

Pick your class from the list of classes available, and write it down in the space provided on your character sheet.
You're starting out at level 1, so write a 1 next to your class.

### Subclasses

At level 1, some classes also get access to their _subclass_ - this is a further set of options presented to each class to increase gameplay variety.
Other classes get this later on in their careers.
Normally getting access to your subclass is indicated by the class description saying something like:

> "At this level, you can pick one of X options from the following list.
> Your choice will grant you additional bonuses at future levels".

If you're not sure if your class is being given it's subclass, ask us and we can help.
We mention this here because, once you get your subclass, you write it in brackets next to your class on your character sheet.
For example, at level 1 Warlocks get their subclass ("otherworldly patron") and choose from a list of options.

- If they choose the Fiend patron, then they write their class as "Warlock (Fiend)"
- If they choose the Archfey patron, then they write their class as "Warlock (Archfey)"

Fighters meanwhile, don't get their subclass ("martial archetype") until level 3.
So they just write their class as "Fighter".
When they later _get_ their subclass, they update this with the option that they chose.

### Example: Erik's Class

Erik is going to be a Ranger, so he writes Ranger - 1 in the class box on his character sheet.

Rangers don't get their subclass until level 3, so Erik doesn't have to worry about recording that yet.

## Assign Your Ability Scores

Now that you have a class, you can actually assign those ability scores from before!
Assign each number to one of your ability scores.

Whilst there's free choice in how you do this, you should prioritise making your classes' primary (and secondary) ability scores your highest.
This will make sure your character is good at the stuff you expect to be doing a lot - it's not a lot of fun to play a character that can't do what they're supposed to.

### Important Ability Scores for each Class

We've listed the important ability scores for each class below.
Once you've assigned your important ability scores, you can fill in the rest - if you had a particular background in mind you might put the remaining "good" ability scores into those that complement this background, for example.
If you're not sure what to prioritise after your classes' important stats, you can't go wrong with making your CON score as high as possible.

- Artificer: INT, then CON
- Barbarian: STR, then CON, then DEX
- Bard: CHA, then DEX and CON
- Cleric: WIS, then STR and CON
- Druid: WIS, then DEX and CON
- Fighter: Either DEX or STR, then CON. If you plan to later subclass for some magical features, you might also want to make your INT your next highest score.
- Monk: DEX, then WIS and CON.
- Paladin:
  - If you want to be more melee focused; STR, then CON, then CHA.
  - If you want to be more spell and support focused; CHA, then CON and STR.
- Ranger:
  - Bow / range focus: DEX, then WIS, then CON.
  - Melee focus: DEX (or even STR if you fancy), CON, then WIS.
  - Spell focused: WIS, then DEX and CON. Generally though, if you want to be a spell-focused ranger, a Druid is a better choice of class.
- Rogue: DEX. Depending on your subclass or background, you might want INT, WIS, CHA to be next.
- Sorcerer: CHA, then CON.
- Warlock: CHA, then CON. If you plan to get involved in melee, you might also want a decent DEX.
- Wizard: INT, then CON.

### Improving Ability Scores

As you level up in a particular class, you will be granted Ability Score Improvements (ASIs) when you reach certain levels.
These will let you further improve one or more of your ability scores, to a maximum of 20.
So don't worry if your ability scores don't give you the biggest bonuses right at the start - this is completely normal!

You don't have to improve the ability scores that are recommended for your class, but it's normally best to.
If they're already at the maximum though, or an important ability score is at an odd number, you can also use this chance to take a "feat" - these are a selection of abilities that you can choose from.
If you want to take a feat, look through the list in the Player's Handbook and ask the DM if it's OK (it probably is, but just make sure).

### Example: Erik's Ability Scores

TODO: Fill with ARC standard array values!

Erik is going to be a melee-focused ranger, so he makes his highest ability score DEX at `<value>`.
Next, he puts the `<value>` into CON to give himself a bit more survivability.
He follows this up with `<value>` into WIS since he might still need it for casting spells in a pinch.
The remaining ability scores of `<VALUES>` he puts into `<X, Y, Z>` respectively:

- List of
- why 
- this order
- if any

## Record your Class Skills and Abilities

The first level in a class also provides you with a number of initial proficiencies; in some combination of skills, weapons, and armour.
Some classes might even offer tools as a proficiency.

Your class will also tell your your initial proficiency bonus, and how it improves as you level up - make sure to record this at the top of your character sheet.

Pick from the list of skills offered to your class (usually you have to choose from a selection) and mark them down on your character sheet.

- Skills should be ticked in the appropriate box to indicate proficiency.
- Weapons, armour, and tools go in the smaller box - you'll have to write them down manually.

Your class also tells you how to calculate your hit point maximum at level 1, and what your hit dice is.

- Write your hit point maximum in the box provided.
- Write down your hit dice in the hit dice box. You'll only have 2, but the _type_ of dice (d6, d8, d10, d12) is what's important.

Finally, record the proficiencies in weapons and armour that your class provides you in the smaller "other proficiencies and languages" box.
You should also mark the _saving throw_ proficiencies that your class provides - you'll want to make sure you have those!

### Example: Erik's Class Skills

Starting as a Ranger, Erik gets to pick three skills from a list of: Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.

Since he's going to be melee focused, he picks Athletics to generally help out when physical strength is required.
He also picks Perception so he's more alert to danger, and Survival so he can help out his friends whilst in the wilderness.

The proficiency bonus for level 1 characters is +2, so Erik writes this into the proficiency bonus box.

The Ranger hit dice is a d10, which Erik records on his character sheet.
His max HP is calculated as 10 + CON modifier at first level, giving him a total of `TODO:value!` at level 1, which he writes down.

Being a Ranger gives Erik proficiency in:

- Light and medium armour,
- Shields,
- Simple and martial weapons

He doesn't get any tool proficiencies from his class.

He does get STR and DEX saving throw proficiencies though, which he checks in the corresponding saving throws box.

## Record your Class Features

Finally, write down any class features that you get given at level 1.
Some of these will give you a choice (like "fighting style"), others will just give you a small boost.
If an ability has a limited number of uses, make sure to write that down too.

If one of your class features lets you learn a language, write that in the languages box on your character sheet.

### Example: Erik's Class Features

At level 1, Rangers get two features from their class; Favoured Foe and Deft Explorer.

- Favoured Foe lets Erik do a little extra damage to one enemy in combat, a certain number of times per long rest (long rest is essentially a day). He writes the name of the ability in the "features and traits" section of his character sheet. He also notices that it can be used "a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before a long rest" - in this case, 2 times per long rest, so he puts two checkboxes next to the ability so he can keep track of them. Finally, he writes the text corresponding to the ability on his spare sheet of paper.
- Deft Explorer gives Erik _expertise_ in one of his skill proficiencies, as well as fluency in two additional languages of his choice. Erik chooses to put his expertise into Perception, so marks that with a _double tick_ in the appropriate skill checkbox - this indicates that his proficiency bonus is doubled when making a Perception check. Finally, he picks two languages to learn - which he chooses to be Sylvan and Elvish - and writes them into his languages box. Again, he copies Deft Explorer onto his spare sheet of paper for later reference.

## Pick Spells

If your class gets access to spells and spell slots at level 1, pick from the selection that it offers.
Write down how many spell slots you have, and the spells you know, on your character sheet.

With spells, there's normally a whole wealth to choose from and it can be overwhelming.
In general;

- If you have access to cantrips, you want at least one cantrip that does damage.
- If you have access to level 1 or higher spells, you'll need to pick those as well.
  - There's no catch-all way to decide this, but generally you want to make sure you have one damaging spell for every spell slot level.
  - Otherwise, pick the spells that sound cool, both in or out of combat. Damage isn't the only way magic can help in your adventures.

### Example: Erik's Spells

Rangers don't get any spells at level 1, so Erik ignores this part of the character sheet.
When he next levels up, he will have to start keeping track of spells.

## Take Note of the Starting Equipment

Your class also provides you with some starting equipment, but we'll do this all at once at the end of character creation.

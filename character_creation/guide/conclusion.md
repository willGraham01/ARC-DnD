If you've made it this far, congratulations - you've done all the hard work and made all the decisions you'll need to.
All that's left is to fill in some final pieces of information on your character sheet, and you're all set to go.

## Skill Modifiers

There is space on the character sheets (indicated with underscores) to write down your modifier for each of the skills, and for your saving throws.
You should already have indicated which skills and saving throws you are proficient in by putting a tick in the corresponding boxes.

If you want to have the modifiers written down explicitly, you can use this space.
Your modifier for a skill is equal to your modifier for the governing ability score (in brackets after the skill name) plus your proficiency bonus if you have proficiency in that skill.
If you have expertise, you double your proficiency bonus when calculating this number.

The same applies for your saving throws - the relevant ability modifier is the one with the same name of course!

You can leave these blank if you prefer.
If you choose to fill them in, don't forget to update them if you later level up and either improve your ability scores, or improve your proficiency bonus.

### Passive Skills

You might have noticed that there are a few "passive skills" listed on your character sheet.
The standard DnD 5th edition sheet has "passive perception", but newer ones also have "passive insight" and "passive investigation".
These abilities represent the base level of awareness or ability in a particular skill your character has; passive perception might let you notice a member of a group slip away from the conversation, passive investigation might give you an innate feeling that someone's logic or story isn't holding up, etc.
In these kinds of situations, the DM might just ask everyone what their passive score is, and see if anyone in the party realises something.

To calculate a "passive skill" score, first work out the your skill modifier for that skill (regular perception for passive perception, insight for passive insight, etc).
Be sure to include your proficiency bonus in that skill if it applies (and expertise, if you have it too).
Then, add 10 to that value, and you have your passive score - write it in the appropriate box on your sheet.

In Erik's case, his passive perception is going to be calculated as 10 + WIS modifier + Perception expertise, giving him a total of 10 + 2 + (2*2) = 16.

## Inspiration?

We haven't touched on the inspiration box on your character sheet yet, but for now we leave it blank.
In a play session, the DM might award you with inspiration for out-of-the-box thinking, comedy value, or leaning into your character when role-playing.
It can be "used" to roll an extra d20 whenever you make an ability check, attack, saving throw, or other roll that requires a d20.

## Is it over now?

We're all done!

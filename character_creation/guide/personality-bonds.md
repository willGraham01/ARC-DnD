title: Character Creation - Personality, Bonds, and Appearance
description: Adding some character to your... character.
---

Mechanically, you're all set to start playing DnD now (well almost, minus the small things we need to do in the conclusion).
But right now you're still playing a character akin to a robot - they have a background sure, but _who_ are they?
This is when we start fleshing this out.

## What's in a Name?

If you haven't decided on a name for your character, now's the time to do it!
If you're struggling for a thematic name, there are plenty of fantasy name generators out there, and the Player's Handbook also gives some example names for each race.

## Appearance

You probably thought about this when choosing your race, but now it's time for some details - what does your character look like?

- How tall are they? (Write this in the box)!
- How old are they? (Write this in the box)!
- What colour is their skin? Is it smooth or scaly (looking at you, Dragonborn)?
- What colour is their hair? How is it styled (if at all)?
- Do they have horns (tielfings) or more bestial features like large tusks you see on or ocs?
- What does their face look like? Eye colour?
- Are they well built or lean?
- What are they wearing? What gear might another character notice when meeting them for the first time?

Write as detailed a description as you like into the character description boxes.
You should at least record your character's height and age for gameplay reasons.

## Personality

Next, describe your character's personality.
If you're not sure where to start with this, you might want to first decide on your character's alignment, then come back here and let your alignment decision guide the personality you create.

What are the immediate aspects of their personality that people might notice?
What bonds or ties do they have to other people or organisations in the world?
What are their goals?
What might their personality flaws be?

You should try to come up with at least two short bullet points for each of the "personality traits" and "ideals", and one for the "bonds" and "flaws" boxes to help flesh out your character.

- Personality traits are small things that set your character apart. They might be their past achievements, likes or dislikes, fears (particularly bad fears might be flaws), mannerisms, or self-attitude.
- Ideals are things that your character values, and what motivates them to do what they do every day. What principles would your character never betray? What motivates them to achieve their goals?
- Bonds represent your character's connections to other people in the world. Do they have family? If so, do they get along with them? Maybe they have a long-standing rival instead.
- Flaws can be vices, compulsions, fears, or any kind of weakness of character. Something that could be exploited against your character. Maybe it's something that gets you irrationally angry. Maybe it's a gambling addiction.

When you're playing the game, remember you're playing as your character - you can use these short bullet points to guide you in that regard.
Further to that point, over the course of several games your character might develop new personality traits, goals, fears, or values too.
Even your alignment is not set once character creation changes.

## Alignment

Finally, based on your character's personality, you can set their "alignment".
This is a broad categorisation of characters, and where they fall on the scale of good to evil, lawful to chaotic.
There are 9 possible categorisations: choose your character's morality from good, neutral, or evil, and your character's societal attitude from lawful, neutral, chaotic.
Some guidance for each of the terms is below:

Morality:

- Good: this character by and large acts in ways that benefit others or communities, not necessarily selflessly. They often go out of their way to be helpful, and try to stay clear of less underhand work unless it serves a purpose.
- Neutral: this character walks the tightrope between good and evil acts. They might simply be a mercenary who doesn't ask any questions, or not understand the implications of their actions. Or they might just be impulsive and regret their choices later, trying to make amends.
- Evil: this character has no issues in doing what they want to achieve what they want. They likely have no qualms about morally reprehensible acts, though they might still have reasonable intentions behind them.

Societal Attitude:

- Lawful: this character has some kind of code that they adhere to when making decisions and expect to be present in the world.
- Neutral: this character feels a great indifference towards the balance of order and chaos. They will likely follow societal codes to the point at which they can get away with deviating from them.
- Chaotic: this character has little time for the conformities of society, and will generally act in a self-centred manner. This does not necessitate harm to others, but more free-thinking outside of societal expectations that might be placed upon others.

## Example: Erik's Personality

Erik stands around 5'10" tall and has an average build, pale skin, and grey eyes.
His dark brown hair is a medium length, and normally twisted in curls due spending several nights in a row in less than comfortable sleeping conditions in the wilderness.
His face sports a short but full beard that is interlaced with cuts and slashes one might get when hurriedly chasing a target through forest or brush.
He wears practical but tired clothes, various leather bracers and greaves on his limbs and a chest plate that looks to be made of small, metallic scales.
Over his back are slung two swords in their scabbards, along with a backpack with a longbow and quiver hanging off it.
The top of the backpack is partially covered by the hood of a scarfed cloak.
If you look closely, you'll see a fairly nice looking ring on his right hand, carved with some kind of crest and sporting Erik's name.

Next, we need to flesh out Erik's personality.
Overall, Erik is certainly lawful - being bound to his unknowing agreement and dutifully seeing it through in spite of his original ignorance.
In terms of morality, Erik is probably somewhere between Neutral and Good - he understands that villages in the wilderness depend on ranger conclaves to keep them safe, but he also needs to feed himself!
After weighing it up, we put Erik down as good - him being on the fence though means that whoever he is adventuring with might tip the scales one way or the other.
Using his alignment, background, and origin as a basis, we settle on:

Personality traits:

- Erik has a manner of speaking that is at odds with his appearance. His language knowledge comes from learning them from trade, so often comes across as overly formal when he's not speaking in his native tongue.
- Erik is never one to turn down a game of cards, dice, or any other pursuits. His ability at them leaves a lot to be desired, though.

Ideals:

- Erik very much adheres to the "my word is my reputation" way of thinking. Once he has signed up to a deal, he will uphold his end of the bargain and expects the other parties to do so to.
- Erik's main goal in recent years has been to attempt to find a way to escape, work off, or renegotiate the terms of his binding contract with the fey that he made unknowingly.

Bonds:

- Erik is still in touch with his family, and their relationship is amicable. He is much closer to his mother and siblings that father.

Flaws:

- Erik's greatest fear is to fail someone who is depending on him, or who he promised to help with something important to them.

title: Character Creation - Starting Equipment
description: Determining your starting equipment.
---

At tis point, you have a character who likely has a bunch of proficiencies in various tools, objects, or armours.
However, you don't actually have any weapons to utilise those proficiencies with!
Fortunately, your class and background provide you with the means to acquire these for free.

## Alternatives: Gold Buy

Some DnD groups prefer to use the "gold buy" method for determining starting equipment.
In this case, rather that use the free equipment that gets provided by each class, you instead get given an initial amount of money based on your class, and can immediately use that to buy your starting equipment.

If you know what you're doing, gold buy is usually optimal as you don't have to lug around any excess items that you're not going to use (fighters for example typically don't need a shield if they plan to go bow & arrow focused, for example) and can instead use that "money" to buy better gear that you will use.
At the levels we play DnD at, this kind of thing won't matter - besides, after one adventure you're normally wealthy enough to buy the "upgrades" that you would have started with anyway.

## Starting Gear from your Class

Your class provides you with some default starting gear, which is often presented as a series of "pick one or the other" options.
Work through the list provided, and make choices based on how you assigned your character's ability scores and skills earlier on in character creation.
Write down what you pick in the equipment box on your character sheet.

Most classes will typically give choice as to which type of weapon you want when you pick one of the two options - the fighter for example can start with "any martial weapon" of their choice.
If so, pick the weapon (or armour!) from the available list of weapons and armour in the Player's Handbook.
Don't write down "any martial weapon" in your equipment - you don't have a Swiss Army knife!

## Starting Gear from your Background

Your background can also provide you with some starting equipment - typically this "equipment" is more akin to personal trinkets, fallback weapons, and changes of clothes for different social settings.
If you used one of the preset backgrounds, copy the gear that it provides onto your character sheet.

If you created your own background, simply pick one set of equipment to have from the other available backgrounds.
Alternatively, talk to the DM about what you think your character would be carrying on them, based on their origins.

Once you have this gear, write it down on your character sheet too.

## Example: Erik's Starting Gear

Eric is a Ranger, so he checks the Ranger class for the starting gear that it provides.

His first choice is between leather armour or scale mail armour.
Scale mail provides him with more protection, so he picks that (a stealthier character might prefer the leather armour, since it doesn't give you disadvantage when sneaking like scale mail does).

His next choice is two shortswords, or two simple melee weapons.
He'll go with the two shortswords, since they work well with his fighting style.

Next up is a dungeoneer's pack or an explorer's pack.
Your choice of pack for most classes is usually fairly arbitrary, as they all tend to contain the same things (rations, rope, a light source, camping gear), but Erik goes with the explorer's pack in this case.

Finally, he starts with a longbow and a quiver (though given he's a melee ranger, they might never see use!).
If we played seriously, he would also log how many arrows he had, but we don't bother to keep track of that.

From his background, Erik still wears his family ring - not anything expensive by any means, but custom to the trading family and embossed with his name.
Other than that, he has a pack of cards and a traveller's dragonchess set, which he uses to pass the time between jobs.
He might also have a few scraps of paper lying around; some blank to be used as letters, some old bounty posters, some letters from his family that he's still in touch with.

## Filling in your Attacks and Armour Class

At this point, you can fill in the "attacks and spellcasting" box with a list of all the various means your character has of attacking someone.
There is no need to record _every way_ - spells in particular you'll likely want to leave off this list since there are a lot of them.

Go through your character's gear and look for weapons that they are proficient in.
If they can cast spells and have a spell attack modifier, you might also want to put that in this list for quick reference.

For each method of attacking, write a row in the "attacks and spellcasting" box that:

- Has the name of the means of attacking. Usually the name of the weapon being used.
- The bonus to hit with this attack. You can write the number in here, or the formula to calculate the number.
- The damage dealt on a hit, and the type of damage. Again, a formula or straight number is fine.

Using the formulas means you won't have to remember to update your character sheet when you level up and you get an ability score increase, or your proficiency bonus increases.
But using the numbers saves you time, so the choice is yours.

Next, you can fill in your armour class (AC) and initiative.
Your initiative modifier is equal to your dexterity modifier, plus any bonuses you might have from your class or starting gear.
Your armour class will depend on how you're choosing to equip yourself.
Pick a type of armour you have available to your character and that you are proficient in, and look at the formula it provides to calculate your armour class.
Some classes - like Wizards and Sorcerers - don't actually start with any armour proficiencies, in this case your armour class is 10 + DEX plus any other bonuses you might have acquired:

- Using a shield (if you are proficient) gives +2 to your AC.
- Some magic items, like a _ring of protection_ also give a slight boost to your AC.
- Some classes, like Barbarians or Monks, have a feature called "unarmoured defence". This provides an alternative means of calculating your AC, which is usually beneficial to those classes.

Whatever the total (or the formula), record it on your character sheet.

### Example: Erik's Attacks and AC

Erik has started out with a pair of shortswords and a longbow.
He plans to be either dual wielding the swords, or using the bow in a fight.
He's proficient in all of these weapons thanks to his "martial weapon" proficiency.

- For the longbow attack, he writes "Longbow, + Prof Bonus + DEX to hit, 1d8 + DEX piercing damage". He could also have written "Longbow, + `TODO` to hit, 1d8 + TODO piercing damage".
- For the sword he wields in his left (main) hand, he writes "Shortsword (main hand), + Prof + DEX to hit, 1d6 + DEX piercing damage".
- For the sword he wields in his right (off) hand, he writes "Shortsword (off hand), + Prof to hit, 1d6 piercing damage". The rules on dual-wield fighting come into play here which is why the main and off-hand attacks are different.

Erik wears his Scale Mail that he started with, which tells him his AC is "14 + DEX (max 2)", giving him a 16 AC.
On top of this, his Dual-Wielder feat will add one to this number whenever he is dual-wielding.

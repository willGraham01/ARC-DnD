title: Character Creation - Choosing your Race
description: How to apply your racial bonuses to your character.
---

You now have a class and the beginnings of a character - it's time to decide what they look like!
Again, if you're not sure on a race, check out our short summary of [the standard races](../classes-and-races-summary.md#races).

## Assign your Racial Ability Score Increases

Most classes provide you with some ability score increases right from the start - you can apply these immediately!
The race will normally say which ability score increases, but as per the revised rules you can change them to any ability score you like.
The only caveat is that if you get two ability score increases from your race, you can't apply them both to the same score.

For example, let's say my character's class is a Paladin; and my ability scores are STR 14, DEX 10, CON 13, INT 11, WIS 9, CHA 16 after determining them.
I choose Tiefling for my race, which normally grants me an ability score increase of +2 to my CHA and +1 to my INT.

- CHA is an important ability score for Paladins, so I'll probably leave the +2 there to make it 18 right from the start.
- But INT isn't as important for Paladins as say STR or CON are though.
  - Giving +1 to STR takes it to 15, but that doesn't improve by STR modifier.
  - Giving the +1 increase to CON though takes it to 14, which moves the modifier up from +1 to +2!
  - Alternatively, I might decide to put the +1 into my WIS - currently it's below 10, so I have a negative WIS modifier. Taking WIS from 9 to 10 means that I'll have a +0 modifier - not great but better than the -1 it would be otherwise!

## Record any Proficiencies your Race gives you

Your race might give you some combination of skill, weapon, armour, skill, or tool proficiencies.
It might also make you fluent in one or more languages.
Make sure to write these down on your character sheet.

It's possible that your race and class might give you access to the _same_ skill proficiencies.
In which case, you might want to go back and swap around the skills that you take from your class.
It's also very common for them to provide some overlap in armour, weapon, and tool proficiencies too - these tend to be unavoidable so don't worry too much about them.

## Record your Speed

Your race determines your starting speed (how far you can move in combat).
Make sure you write this down in the "speed" box on your character sheet.
Your class might later improve this speed.

## Record any Racial Features or Spells

Finally, your race might provide some special features (like the half-orc's "relentless") or some innate spellcasting (like the tiefling's "hellish rebuke").
Record these features in the usual features and abilities section.

If you get some spells as part of your race, write them down in the spells section of your character sheet.
Make sure you indicate that these spells come from your race - this is so you don't later confuse them with the ones you get from your class!

### Example: Erik's Race

Erik is a human.
Humans start of knowing how to speak Common, plus one other language of their choice - the Player's Handbook recommends this be the language of a race your character frequently visited or lived with.

Humans can then choose between either:

- +1 to all their ability scores, or
- +1 to 2 of their ability scores, a skill proficiency, and a feat.

Erik picks Dwarven for his extra language, and puts that plus Common into his language box (he would have taken Elvish, but he already has that from his class choices).
For his extra skill proficiency, he'll choose Animal Handling and check the appropriate skill box on his character sheet.
For his feat, Erik will take the "Dual Wielder" feat - he writes it's name down in the features and traits box, then copies the text from the feat onto his spare sheet of paper for reference.

For his two +1 increases, Erik puts them into `TODO:FIX ME AFTER ARC INTRO SESSION`!

Humans start with a speed of 30 (ft), which Erik records.

Humans don't get any spellcasting abilities from their race, so Erik skips over this part.

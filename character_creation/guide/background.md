title: Character Creation - Creating your Background
description: Creating a background for your character, mechanically and thematically.
---

Your character's background, alongside their personality, is your chance to give the character you play some dimension or some uniqueness.
It also provides a couple of mechanical benefits in the form of skill proficiencies, and normally some language or tool proficiencies too.

You might choose to come up with your character's background before you pick their race and class - this is a common way to come up with a character concept.
If anything, it is the reverse focus to how we are presenting things in this guide; where we choose the important mechanics first, and then build our character around our choices.
Both methods of creating a character are perfectly fine - people usually have a preference either way.
For some people, they like to emulate a character they know from fiction and try to translate them into DnD.
For others, they prefer to pick _how_ they want to play DnD and then build the character around those choices.

Regardless of the method you pick, once you start to come up with your background there is no rule against going back through what we've already done and changing some of your decisions.
Maybe you'd rather take another language now that your have a background.
Maybe you'd rather be a Dwarf than a Human now that your background has been fleshed out.
There's nothing stopping you from making these changes retrospectively - it's all part of the creation process!

## Creating a Background (Mechanically)

Mechanically, all you need to do when creating a background is:

- Pick two skills (preferably ones you aren't already proficient in from your race or class).
- Pick a total of two languages or tool sets (so 2 tools, 2 languages, or 1 of each). A list of options is available in the Player's Handbook or Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.
- Come up with a background feature (or choose one of the default ones).

You gain proficiency in the skills you chose, and in the tool sets you chose (if any).
Record these on your character sheet.

You also become fluent in the two languages that you picked - again write these down onto your character sheet.
Again, you'll want to pick languages that you aren't already fluent in from your race (and potentially your class).

Your background feature will be discussed below.

## Background Features

At this point you should start to think about where your character comes from, and how they got to be whatever class they are now you're making them.
You'll also want to tie this into why their background gives them the skills you chose, and the languages or tools.

- Maybe they're part of a trading family who often visited foreign lands, hence they picked up non-native Elvish and Dwarven.
- Maybe they're an apprentice blacksmith, which is how they got their training in smith's tools and learnt Dwarven.
- Maybe they've always been good at tinkering and improvising, which is why they're proficient in tinkerer's and thieves' tools.

The player's handbook has a list of pre-set backgrounds that you can use if you don't want to come up with your own "background feature".
But these features are more story elements rather than mechanical benefits:

- Our trader would likely have a better understanding of where to go in a new town for information, and be a bit more wise to getting marked as a tourist my the locals.
- Our blacksmith's apprentice would probably have an easier time talking shop with a another blacksmith, if trying to haggle for a discount on gear.
- Our tinkerer would probably have an eye for curious contraptions or be able to spot when something otherwise undamaged has needed repairs.

In all these cases, the benefits are more story based and typically don't play into the mechanics of combat.
It's mainly there for you to place your character into the world as an actual person.

## Example: Erik's Background

### Background Text

Erik was the eldest child in a reasonably wealthy merchant family, but he was much more interested in swordplay and fairytales than learning the merchant trade.
This caused a small amount of ire between his parents and siblings, all of whom were much more focused on continuation of the family business.
It also reflected poorly on the family business when meeting with clients - Erik's rather indifferent attitude as the heir assumptive came off as brash and dismissive with the clientele.

On one particular business trip, the family's caravan was ambushed deep in a forest by bandits.
They were saved thanks to a timely intervention by a group of druids, rangers, and tree spirits who had been tracking the bandits for a few weeks.
Erik was naturally awed by their savours with his obsession over adventuring stories, and whilst the caravan was escorted to safety spent much of the trip trying to converse with the rangers.
His father sensed an opportunity to satisfy both Erik's desire for adventure, solve the issue of the family business inheritance, and show gratitude to their rescuers, extended the offer that once Erik that when was old enough, he would join the ranger conclave and train with them.
A rather naive Erik accepted, in the presence of the druids, rangers, and rather importantly, the woodland (fey) spirits.

When we meet Erik, he is in his mid 20s having joined the ranger conclave at 18.
His preconceptions of an exciting, adventurous lifestyle have been checked by the reality of survival in the wilderness and the deadliness of combat.
The ranger lifestyle is more one of individuals who cooperate when they happen to be working towards the same objective or tracking the same bounty, rather than a coherent regiment that travels together.
Perhaps more worryingly, Erik now realises the binding nature of his promise in front of the fey spirits - entering into a deal with the fey is often binding, even if entering unknowingly.

### Background Mechanics

The background text above serves as Erik's background "feature".
He retains some of the business sense from his days trying to learn the family trade, although this has dwindled since he joined the conclave.
Still, he knows how to haggle when discussing a bounty or other job.

The remaining text ties into his class (and to an extent race) choices.
He chose Sylvan as a language from his Ranger class features with this background in mind (Sylvan is the fey language), for example.

Erik's background still gives him 2 more skill proficiencies and 2 more language or tool proficiencies.
For his skills;

- He picks Persuasion to reflect his bartering ability that started from his merchant origins and has been refined since becoming a ranger.
- He picks Medicine to reflect what he's learnt about surviving alone in the wilderness. He already has the Survival skill from his class, otherwise he might have taken it here instead.
- He ticks the appropriate check boxes on his character sheet.

For the languages and tools;

- Erik already knows Dwarven and Elvish, two common trade languages that he'd reasonably know from his background.
- Orcish tribes typically form a high proportion of bandit bounties and threats to villages in the wilderness, so Erik takes Orcish as a language proficiency that he's picked up out of necessity when tracking, spying and potentially negotiating with them.
- Other things to consider are potentially proficiency in Artisan's tools (from his merchant training) or proficiency in Healers / Herbalism kits to play into the survival element of his background. As it's been a while since Erik last practised with Artisan's tools, he takes proficiency in the Herbalism kit instead.

These skill proficiencies have the appropriate boxes checked, whilst the languages and tools go into the "other proficiencies" box as normal.
Erik's background text is copied either onto the spare sheet of paper, or onto page 2 of his character sheet.

title: Character Creation - Determining Ability Scores
description: How to determine your character's ability scores.
---

The first stage of character creation is determining your ability scores.
Note that we're just _determining_ them at this stage - we'll assign them once we decide on our character's class.

## Characters for ARC-DnD

At ARC, we use the [ARC standard array](../creation-guidelines.md#the-arc-standard-array) for our character scores.
These were determined at our first character creation session.

## Other Methods of Determining Ability Scores

If you're wanting to make a character for a game outside of ARC, there are several methods for determining your character's ability scores.
The DM for that particular game might ask you to use one or the other, so we'll give a quick overview here.

You'll add your bonuses from your race (and potentially background) to these values in the later steps.

### Player's Handbook Standard Array

The Player's Handbook has a standard set of ability scores that you can use for your character.
Just look them up and write down the values, then assign them when it comes to it.

### Point Buy

The method of determining stats favoured by veterans and the slightly more serious end of DnD tables.
It ensures balance between all the characters in the party by letting you spend "points" to increase your ability scores.
This gives you a lot of control over which ability scores you want to make sure are good, and which ones you don't mind having particularly low.

There are variations on this as always, but the typical setup is that all your ability scores start at 8, and you have a pool of 27 points.
You can spend 1 point to increase an ability score by one, up to a value of 13.
Increasing an ability score from 13 to 14 costs 2 points, as does 14 to 15, and ability scores cannot go higher than that.

You can find several point-buy calculators online, but [the one here](https://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html) is fairly good.

### Rolling for Stats

Roll dice 6 times to get 6 numbers, and use those as your ability scores.
This method in of itself has countless variations for determining ability scores.
Some of the more common ones:

- "3d6": Roll 3d6 and use the total as the score value. Repeat 6 times.
- "4d6 drop lowest": Roll 4d6 and remove the lowest value. The total of the remaining dice is the score. Repeat 6 times.
- "reroll-ones": Use one the methods above, but re-roll any 1s that appear on the dice (only re-roll each dice maximum once). Repeat 6 times.

After employing whichever method you've been instructed to do, you'll have 6 numbers to use for your ability scores.
Sometimes you'll roll for stats as a group with everyone contributing one number - this helps balance things out amongst the players so someone doesn't start with three 18s whilst another starts with two 9s and a 10.

The ARC standard array was determined using the "4d6 drop lowest, re-roll ones" method, as a group.

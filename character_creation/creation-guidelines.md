title: Character Creation - Guidelines
description: Sources, options, and conventions when making a character for ARC DnD.
---

This page is a quick guide as to the character customisation house rules and customisation options that ARC uses.
In general, we're pretty relaxed when it comes to what you want to use, and what's below is more "this is what we currently work with" rather than "you must stay within these boundaries or else".
If you do stray outside the guidelines, just make sure you run your options passed one of the DMs before you turn up - there shouldn't be any problems but we want to make sure that no-one misses out on options they didn't know were available!

- We allow all classes and subclasses from the Player's Handbook, Xanethar's Guide to Everything, and Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.
- We use the [ARC standard array](#the-arc-standard-array) for determining ability scores (pre-bonuses).
- We allow all races from the Player's Handbook. Re-flavourings (like "half orc" to "orc") are OK too.
- We allow you to reassign your racial ability score increases as per Tasha's Cauldron of everything.
- We allow the customise your origin options from Tasha's Cauldron when determining character _backgrounds_.
- We use the starting gear provided by your class and/or background (as opposed to gold buy).
- Multi-classing is OK but do so at your own behest and maintenance - our guide doesn't cover this!
- We allow all spells from Player's Handbook, Xanethar's Guide to Everything, and Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.

## The ARC Standard Array

The ARC standard array was determined at our first group character creation session, and is the set of ability scores that we all use.
Your racial (and origin, if applicable) bonuses are applied as usual on top of these values, and you can assign them in any particular order you choose.

The standard array is:

```bash
A, B, C, D, E, F
```

title: Summary of Classes and Races
description: A short summary of the various classes and races available to players.
---

Coming into DnD for the first time and being told to "make a character" can be very overwhelming at first.
Even before you start playing, you have to make two of the most important decisions for the character you're going to play - your class and race.
And they're not easy decisions to make - even if you have a good idea of what the various classes and races have to offer!

This page aims to provide an overview of the options you have when it comes to these decisions.
There's a mixture of flavour text and no-details summary, which if you're new to the game we recommend you base all of your decisions off of.
Alongside the flavour text; there's also further information about how the class / race plays mechanically, important stats, and potential synergies.
For the classes, we also give a rather general "complexity" rating, more on that later.

We'll only be going into the races and classes available in the following source books:

- Player's Handbook,
- Tasha's Cauldron of everything,
- Xanathar's Guide to everything

## Races

Your race usually provides one or more of the following:

- Ability score increases (ASI)
- Languages
- Proficiencies
- Innate magic (free spells)
- A racial ability (darkvision to see in the dark, for example)

More information about these things is in the character creation guide sections.

_Generally speaking_ you'll pick your class before you pick your race on character creation, although it's close.
With the customisation options available; any race can play as any class, although some races are geared slightly towards particular classes than others.
We have indicated these in the table where relevant, but there is absolutely no reason to think that a race _has_ to be one of these classes to be effective.

| Race | Flavour Text | Particular Class Synergies |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Dwarf| A race that typically values order, wealth, honour, and tradition. Slow to trust but loyal once it is gained. | Melee or ranged weapon focused classes |
| Elf | Long lived, graceful, and free thinking, elvish society is very refined since living that long means you inevitably acquire nice possessions. | |
| Halfling | The hobbits of DnD. Outgoing and upbeat, but also sneaky and mischievous when they feel the urge. | Rogue |
| Human | Your vanilla human - there is nothing typical about humans. | |
| Dragonborn | Descended from dragons, part of a society made up of independent clans, dragonborn are proud of their heritage... and effective at using it. | Melee fighters, sorcerers and warlocks |
| Gnome | Like halflings, gnomes are generally upbeat about life, viewing every day as a gift to be enjoyed to it's fullest. | Artificer, Wizard, Rogues, ranged attackers |
| Half-elf | Combining human curiosity with elvish refinement, half-elves are ambitious but cooperative. | |
| Half-orc / Orc | Orcish society is tough, nomadic, and a constant fight for survival. Orc tribes typically form the backbone of marauder bands or mercenary groups. | Melee fighters |
| Tiefling | Descended from devils, tieflings sport horns, forked tails, and skin hues anywhere between red and blue. Though not naturally evil by nature, most races view them with distrust. | Spellcasters |

## Classes

Your class dictates by-and-large what your character is good at, and which role they'll slot into alongside the rest of your adventuring party.
You can read more about them in the table below, and the additional columns are explained below.

| Class | Description | Mechanical Description | Complexity |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|----------|
| Artificer | Masters of invention, who imbue mundane objects to make them magical - and animate. | A blend of magical tools to use from range and supporting options in the form of robot companions or firearms. Outside of combat, they are keen investigators and mechanics. | B+ |
| Barbarian | Fierce warriors of primitive backgrounds, who enter a battle rage. | Hit hard in melee and can take a lot of hits. Outside of a fight, they provide the party with survival tactics, tracking, and coercion. | C |
| Bard | Inspiring magicians whose power comes from the music of creation. | Access to a wealth of spells and abilities to help their allies in and out of combat. Normally the life of the party in social situations. | A |
| Cleric | A priest who wields holy magic in service to a god. | Spellcasters that focus on healing their allies, debuffing enemies and controlling the battle. Can also get stuck in with a weapon if they fancy. | A |
| Druid | Wields the power of nature, and combines it with the ability to shapeshift into animals. | Much like a cleric, with slightly more focus on controlling a fight and turning into a bear if all else fails. Outside of combat, they provide a lot of survival expertise. | A+ |
| Fighter | Masters of martial combat; be it with bow, spear, sword, or axe. | No magical ability, it's all about your weapon use. Tough to kill, and can be melee or ranged weapon focused. Outside of combat, they can take a wide range of skills from social etiquette, historial knowledge, and tactical analysis. | C+ |
| Monk | Focused on martial arts - particularly unarmed combat, with powers that come from the spirit. | Agile, mobile, and fast, monks are hit-and-run masters in combat with their unarmed strikes. They have "ki" powers as a kind of magical substitute to complement their abilities. | B |
| Paladin | A holy warrior bound to a sacred oath. | A melee fighter that's very good at keeping their allies safe and keeping enemies occupied. | B+ |
| Ranger | A blend of nature magic and martial skills, natural scouts and wilderness fighters. | Can bond with animals, and use a small range of spells to complement their weapon abilities. Typically utilise a longbow and ambush tactics, and scout ahead. | B |
| Rogue | Subterfuge, underhand tactics, and a reliable talent that can't be found elsewhere. Thieves, investigators, and pirates are all rogues. | Tend to use stealth in combat to surprise enemies, and very good at scouting ahead for their friends. No magical abilities, but incredibly good at the skills they are proficient in. | C+ |
| Sorcerer | Spellcasters who draw on their innate magic to channel their power. | Access to a wide range of spells, and the ability to manipulate how said spells are cast, take effect, or perform. Tend to avoid physical weapons and stay clear of the melee brawl. | B |
| Warlock | Warlocks get their magical power from a bargain with another entity, rather than it being innate. | Primarily relies on cantrips (free spells) or weapons in combat, and saves their powerful spells for out of combat utility or really important moments. Get magical invocations to provide consistent bonuses to make up for their access to fewer spells. | B+ |
| Wizard | A scholar who has learnt to wield magic after devoting years to it's study. | Access to the widest range of spells for all purposes - control, damage, and utility out of combat. | A |

### Complexity

This is a subjective measure of how many things you'll need to keep track of when playing this class.
A "more complex" class is not necessarily better than any of the other classes, this ranking is just there for you to use as a guide for how many abilities, resources, and spells that your character has access to.
Naturally, this bumps the magic-using characters up the list since you'll need to keep track of which spells you know, and have used.

Don't be put off playing a class that sounds exciting to you just because of this ranking.
Many would disagree with it - and with perfectly valid reasons.

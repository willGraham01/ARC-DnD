## Character Listings

When you create a new character, add them to the list below along with a link to their character page.
Be sure to include your name next to the character in the list so we know who has played them!

## Adding a Character

Open a full request against this repository, which adds:

- Your character to the list above, and a link to their character page.
- A character page for them in the `character_vault/pcs` folder. You can copy one of the existing character pages to use as a template.
- Their character sheet to the `assets/char-sheets` folder.

The character page doesn't need to contain much information, so long as it contains a link to the character sheet itself.
But you might want to put (anything you are OK with being publicly known from) their backstory, personality, appearance, etc information on this page so it's not just barren.

## Background
<!-- Add as much or as little as you like, but keep in mind that everyone will be able to see this! -->

Erik was the eldest child in a reasonably wealthy merchant family, but he was much more interested in swordplay and fairytales than learning the merchant trade.
This caused a small amount of ire between his parents and siblings, all of whom were much more focused on continuation of the family business.
It also reflected poorly on the family business when meeting with clients - Erik's rather indifferent attitude as the heir assumptive came off as brash and dismissive with the clientele.

On one particular business trip, the family's caravan was ambushed deep in a forest by bandits.
They were saved thanks to a timely intervention by a group of druids, rangers, and tree spirits who had been tracking the bandits for a few weeks.
Erik was naturally awed by their savours with his obsession over adventuring stories, and whilst the caravan was escorted to safety spent much of the trip trying to converse with the rangers.
His father sensed an opportunity to satisfy both Erik's desire for adventure, solve the issue of the family business inheritance, and show gratitude to their rescuers, extended the offer that once Erik that when was old enough, he would join the ranger conclave and train with them.
A rather naive Erik accepted, in the presence of the druids, rangers, and rather importantly, the woodland (fey) spirits.

When we meet Erik, he is in his mid 20s having joined the ranger conclave at 18.
His preconceptions of an exciting, adventurous lifestyle have been checked by the reality of survival in the wilderness and the deadliness of combat.
The ranger lifestyle is more one of individuals who cooperate when they happen to be working towards the same objective or tracking the same bounty, rather than a coherent regiment that travels together.
Perhaps more worryingly, Erik now realises the binding nature of his promise in front of the fey spirits - entering into a deal with the fey is often binding, even if entering unknowingly.
As such, he is more bound to this manner of existence that perhaps he would like - having to heed the call of fey when they require assistance in whatever machinations they have going, and otherwise left to survive until needed again.

## Appearance
<!-- See the character creation guide for ideas on what details to include here. -->

Erik stands around 5'10" tall and has an average build, pale skin, and grey eyes.
His dark brown hair is a medium length, and normally twisted in curls due spending several nights in a row in less than comfortable sleeping conditions in the wilderness.
It even has fresh flowers that appear to have either grown or been placed there during the night and gradually fallen loose during the day.
His face sports a short but full beard that is interlaced with cuts and slashes one might get when hurriedly chasing a target through forest or brush.
He wears practical but tired clothes, various leather bracers and greaves on his limbs and a chest plate that looks to be made of small, metallic scales.
Over his back are slung two swords in their scabbards, along with a backpack with a longbow and quiver hanging off it.
The top of the backpack is partially covered by the hood of a scarfed cloak.
If you look closely, you'll see a fairly nice looking ring on his right hand, carved with some kind of crest and sporting Erik's name.

## Personality
<!-- See the character creation guide for ideas on what details to include here. -->

Personality traits:

- Erik has a manner of speaking that is at odds with his appearance. His language knowledge comes from learning them from trade, so often comes across as overly formal when he's not speaking in his native tongue.
- Erik is never one to turn down a game of cards, dice, or any other pursuits. His ability at them leaves a lot to be desired, though.

Ideals:

- Erik very much adheres to the "my word is my reputation" way of thinking. Once he has signed up to a deal, he will uphold his end of the bargain and expects the other parties to do so to.
- Erik's main goal in recent years has been to attempt to find a way to escape, work off, or renegotiate the terms of his binding contract with the fey that he made unknowingly.

Bonds:

- Erik is still in touch with his family, and their relationship is amicable. He is much closer to his mother and siblings that father.

Flaws:

- Erik's greatest fear is to fail someone who is depending on him, or who he promised to help with something important to them.

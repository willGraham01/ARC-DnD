Some flavour text is coming for the landing page, I swear guys.

## [Character Creation Guide](./character_creation/index.md)

A short guide to some of the things you should consider and know when making a character.
You'll still need the source material to hand, or a tool like DnDBeyond that can display it for you,
but there's some useful stuff here for making a character to join in an adventure.

Don't forget to use the [ARC standard array](./character_creation/creation-guidelines.md#the-arc-standard-array) when making your character!

[Head to the guide](./character_creation/index.md).

## [Character Vault](./character_vault/index.md)

Listing of all the playable characters that people have created, so if you forget your character sheet on the day, you can retrieve it from here.
Also includes some short guidelines for adding characters as you make them.
